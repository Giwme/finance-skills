# Buyer List

description: Build and organize a universe of potential acquirers for sell-side M&A processes. Identifies strategic and financial buyers, assesses fit, and prioritizes outreach. Use when preparing for a sell-side mandate, building a buyer universe, or evaluating potential partners. Triggers on "buyer list", "buyer universe", "potential acquirers", "who would buy this", "strategic buyers", or "financial sponsors".

## 输出规则（CRITICAL）

### 直接输出 vs 生成文件

**默认行为：直接输出文本内容**
- Markdown、纯文本内容 → 直接回复，**不生成 .md 文件**
- 除非用户明确要求"生成文件"、"保存为"、"导出"

**需要生成文件的情况：**
- 生成 Excel (.xlsx)、PPT (.pptx)、Word (.docx)、PDF (.pdf) 等二进制文件
- 用户明确要求："生成 md 文件"、"保存报告"、"导出到文件"
- 内容超过 4000 字符，需要作为附件下载

### .done 文件规则

**.done 文件的 `files` 字段只包含二进制文件：**

```python
# 只将二进制文件计入 completed_files（文本内容直接输出）
completed_files = [
    f.name for f in output_dir.iterdir() 
    if f.is_file() 
    and not f.name.startswith(".") 
    and not f.name.endswith(".tmp")
    and f.suffix.lower() in [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".docx", ".pdf"]  # 只包含二进制文件
]
```

## Run ID Isolation (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)

**All file outputs MUST be isolated per request using run_id.**

### Run Context

User messages may contain a marker:

```
[[OPENCLAW_RUN_ID: <run_id>]]
```

**If present, you MUST:**

1. **Extract the run_id** from the marker
2. **When executing any script or generating files, always pass it as:**
   ```
   --run-id <run_id>
   ```
3. **All generated artifacts MUST be written under:**
   ```
   /home/ubuntu/.openclaw-public/workspace/<run_id>/
   ```

**NEVER write artifacts directly into the workspace root.**

### Implementation Pattern

```python
import re
import argparse
from pathlib import Path

# Extract run_id from conversation context
context = """{{user_input}}"""
match = re.search(r'\[\[OPENCLAW_RUN_ID:\s*([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)\]\]', context)
run_id = match.group(1) if match else 'default'

# Create isolated output directory
workspace = Path("/home/ubuntu/.openclaw-public/workspace")
output_dir = workspace / run_id
output_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Write all files to this directory
output_file = output_dir / f"Buyer_List_{date}.xlsx"
```

### Completion Marker (REQUIRED)

After ALL files are generated:

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime

completed_files = [
    f.name for f in output_dir.iterdir() 
    if f.is_file() 
    and not f.name.startswith(".") 
    and not f.name.endswith(".tmp")
    and f.suffix.lower() in [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".docx", ".pdf"]  # 只包含二进制文件，文本内容直接输出
]

done_file = output_dir / ".done"
done_data = {
    "status": "completed",
    "run_id": run_id,
    "skill": "buyer-list",
    "files": completed_files,
    "file_count": len(completed_files),
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
}
done_file.write_text(json.dumps(done_data, indent=2))
```

### Completion Announcement (REQUIRED)

After writing the `.done` file, you MUST announce completion in this exact format:

```
✅ 任务完成，文件已生成：{filename}
```

Example:
```
✅ 任务完成，文件已生成：Buyer_List_2026-03-06.xlsx
```

This signals the frontend to display the download card immediately.

**Violation of this rule causes file collisions between concurrent users.**

## OpenAI/Codex Tooling Guardrails (Shared)

Apply these rules when using runtime tools (especially with openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex):

1. Python runtime
- Always use `python3`.
- Never use `python`.

2. web_search language
- For Chinese queries, use `search_lang: "zh-hans"`.
- Do not use `search_lang: "zh"`.
- If language is not critical, omit `search_lang`.

3. web_search execution strategy
- Run searches serially (avoid parallel bursts).
- Use minimum queries needed (typically 3-5).
- Add throttle between calls (~1.2-1.8s).

4. Error auto-recovery
- On 422 with invalid `search_lang`, retry once with `zh-hans`.
- On 429 RATE_LIMITED, back off (wait longer), reduce query count, then retry.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Target

- Company description, sector, and business model
- Revenue, EBITDA, and growth profile
- Key assets and capabilities (IP, customer relationships, geographic footprint, team)
- Expected valuation range
- Seller preferences (strategic vs. financial, management continuity, timeline)

### Step 2: Strategic Buyers

Identify strategic acquirers across categories:

**Direct Competitors**
- Companies in the same space that would gain market share
- Rationale: Revenue synergies, eliminate competitor, scale

**Adjacent Players**
- Companies in adjacent markets that could expand into target's space
- Rationale: Product extension, cross-sell, new market entry

**Vertical Integrators**
- Customers or suppliers that could integrate vertically
- Rationale: Supply chain control, margin capture, strategic lock-in

**Platform Builders**
- Large companies building a platform in the space through M&A
- Rationale: Tuck-in acquisition, fill capability gap

For each strategic buyer, assess:

| Buyer | Sector | Revenue | Strategic Fit | Financial Capacity | M&A Track Record | Likelihood | Priority |
|-------|--------|---------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|------------|----------|
| | | | High/Med/Low | | Active/Moderate/None | | A/B/C |

### Step 3: Financial Sponsors

Identify PE/financial buyers:

**Platform Investors**
- Sponsors looking for a new platform in this sector
- Criteria: Fund size, sector focus, deal size range

**Add-on Buyers**
- Sponsors with existing portfolio companies that could acquire target as bolt-on

**Growth Equity**
- For earlier-stage or high-growth targets
- Minority vs. majority preference

For each sponsor:

| Sponsor | Fund Size | Sector Focus | Portfolio Overlap | Recent Activity | Priority |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| | | | | | A/B/C |

### Step 4: Prioritization

Tier the buyer list:

- **Tier 1 (5-10)**: Highest strategic fit, proven acquirers, clear rationale — contact first
- **Tier 2 (10-15)**: Good fit but less obvious — contact in second wave
- **Tier 3 (10-20)**: Possible but lower probability — contact if process needs broadening

### Step 5: Contact Mapping

For each Tier 1 buyer:
- Key decision maker (CEO, Corp Dev head, Partner)
- Relationship status (existing, cold outreach, need introduction)
- Known preferences or constraints
- Best approach channel

### Step 6: Output

- Excel workbook with:
  - Strategic buyers tab (sorted by tier)
  - Financial sponsors tab (sorted by tier)
  - Contact mapping for Tier 1
  - Summary statistics
- One-page buyer universe summary for engagement letter or pitch

## Important Notes

- Quality over quantity — 30-40 well-researched buyers beats 200 names
- Research recent M&A activity — buyers who just did a deal may be hungry for more or tapped out
- Check for antitrust concerns with direct competitors
- Financial sponsors: check fund vintage and deployment pace
- Always ask seller about buyers to include/exclude
- Update list as process progresses
