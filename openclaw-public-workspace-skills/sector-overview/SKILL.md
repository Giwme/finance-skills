## 输出规则（CRITICAL）

### 直接输出 vs 生成文件

**默认行为：直接输出文本内容**
- Markdown、纯文本内容 → 直接回复，**不生成 .md 文件**
- 除非用户明确要求"生成文件"、"保存为"、"导出"

**需要生成文件的情况：**
- 生成 Excel (.xlsx)、PPT (.pptx)、Word (.docx)、PDF (.pdf) 等二进制文件
- 用户明确要求："生成 md 文件"、"保存报告"、"导出到文件"
- 内容超过 4000 字符，需要作为附件下载

### .done 文件规则

**.done 文件的 `files` 字段只包含二进制文件：**

```python
# 只将二进制文件计入 completed_files（文本内容直接输出）
completed_files = [
    f.name for f in output_dir.iterdir() 
    if f.is_file() 
    and not f.name.startswith(".") 
    and not f.name.endswith(".tmp")
    and f.suffix.lower() in [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".docx", ".pdf"]  # 只包含二进制文件
]
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Data Freshness Requirement

**🚨 TRAINING DATA IS OUTDATED - ALWAYS USE WEB SEARCH 🚨**

**BEFORE STARTING:**
1. **Check today's date** and write it down
2. **ALL market data must be from web_search**, not training data (cutoff: early 2024)
3. **Target data freshness:** Use 最新季度优先，其次 FY2025 data, or latest available quarterly results
4. **Never use pre-2024 data** for TAM, market share, or growth rates without explicit labeling

**FREE Data Sources (Brave API + web_search)** ✅:
- **Statista** - 免费 TAM 数据 (需标注来源)
- **Grand View Research, Mordor Intelligence** - 行业报告摘要
- **SEC EDGAR** - 上市公司财务数据
- **Yahoo Finance / Google Finance** - 股价、市值、财务指标
- **公司 Investor Relations 页面** - 财报、业绩演示
- **Industry association reports** - 行业协会免费报告

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] TAM and market size data includes source URL and date
- [ ] Growth rates explicitly state the period (e.g., "2024-2025")
- [ ] Company financials are from **最新季度优先，其次 FY2025**
- [ ] Market share data is current (within last 12 months)

## Run ID Isolation (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)

**All file outputs MUST be isolated per request using run_id.**

### Run Context

User messages may contain a marker:

```
[[OPENCLAW_RUN_ID: <run_id>]]
```

**If present, you MUST:**

1. **Extract the run_id** from the marker
2. **When executing any script or generating files, always pass it as:**
   ```
   --run-id <run_id>
   ```
3. **All generated artifacts MUST be written under:**
   ```
   /home/ubuntu/.openclaw-public/workspace/<run_id>/
   ```

**NEVER write artifacts directly into the workspace root.**

### Completion Marker (REQUIRED)

After ALL files are generated:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime

output_dir = Path(f"/home/ubuntu/.openclaw-public/workspace/{run_id}")
completed_files = [
    f.name for f in output_dir.iterdir() 
    if f.is_file() 
    and not f.name.startswith(".") 
    and not f.name.endswith(".tmp")
    and f.suffix.lower() in [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".docx", ".pdf"]  # 只包含二进制文件，文本内容直接输出
]

done_file = output_dir / ".done"
done_data = {
    "status": "completed",
    "run_id": run_id,
    "skill": "sector-overview",
    "files": completed_files,
    "file_count": len(completed_files),
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
}
done_file.write_text(json.dumps(done_data, indent=2))
```

### Completion Announcement (REQUIRED)

After writing the `.done` file, you MUST announce completion in this exact format:

```
✅ 任务完成，文件已生成：{filename}
```

Example:
```
✅ 任务完成，文件已生成：EV_Sector_Overview_2026-03-06.pptx
```

This signals the frontend to display the download card immediately.

**Violation of this rule causes file collisions between concurrent users.**

## OpenAI/Codex Tooling Guardrails (Shared)

Apply these rules when using runtime tools (especially with openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex):

1. Python runtime
- Always use `python3`.
- Never use `python`.

2. web_search language
- For Chinese queries, use `search_lang: "zh-hans"`.
- Do not use `search_lang: "zh"`.
- If language is not critical, omit `search_lang`.

3. web_search execution strategy
- Run searches serially (avoid parallel bursts).
- Use minimum queries needed (typically 3-5).
- Add throttle between calls (~1.2-1.8s).

4. Error auto-recovery
- On 422 with invalid `search_lang`, retry once with `zh-hans`.
- On 429 RATE_LIMITED, back off (wait longer), reduce query count, then retry.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Scope

- **Sector / subsector**: What industry and how narrowly defined?
- **Purpose**: Client report, internal research, pitch material, idea generation
- **Depth**: High-level overview (5-10 pages) or deep dive (20-30 pages)
- **Angle**: Neutral landscape vs. thematic thesis (e.g., "AI infrastructure buildout")
- **Universe**: Public companies only, or include private?

### Step 2: Market Overview

**Market Size & Growth**
- Total addressable market (TAM) with source
- Historical growth rate (5-year CAGR)
- Forecast growth rate and key assumptions
- Market segmentation (by product, geography, end market, customer type)

**Industry Structure**
- Fragmented vs. consolidated — top 5 market share
- Value chain map — where does value accrue?
- Business model types (subscription, transaction, licensing, services)
- Barriers to entry (capital, regulatory, technical, network effects)

**Key Trends & Drivers**
- Secular tailwinds (3-5 major trends)
- Headwinds and risks
- Technology disruption vectors
- Regulatory developments
- M&A activity and consolidation trends

### Step 3: Competitive Landscape

**Company Profiles** (for top 5-10 players):

| Company | Revenue | Growth | EBITDA Margin | Market Share | Key Differentiator |
|---------|---------|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| | | | | | |

For each company, brief profile:
- Business description (2-3 sentences)
- Strategic positioning and moat
- Recent developments (earnings, M&A, product launches)
- Valuation snapshot (P/E, EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue)

**Competitive Dynamics**
- How do companies compete? (price, product, service, distribution)
- Who is gaining/losing share and why?
- Disruption risk from new entrants or adjacent players

### Step 4: Valuation Context

- Sector trading multiples (current and historical range)
- Premium/discount drivers (growth, margins, market position)
- Recent M&A transaction multiples
- How does the sector compare to the broader market?

### Step 5: Investment Implications

- Where are the best risk/reward opportunities?
- What thematic bets can be expressed through this sector?
- Key debates in the sector (bull vs. bear arguments)
- Catalysts that could change the sector narrative

### Step 6: Output

- Word document or PowerPoint with:
  - Market overview and sizing
  - Competitive landscape map
  - Company comparison table
  - Valuation summary
  - Key charts: market growth, share trends, valuation history
- Excel appendix with detailed company data

## Important Notes

- Source all market size data — cite the research firm or methodology
- Distinguish between TAM hype and realistic addressable market
- Sector overviews age fast — note the date and flag data that may be stale
- Charts are essential — market size waterfall, competitive positioning matrix, valuation scatter plot
- If for a client, tailor the "so what" to their specific situation (M&A target identification, competitive positioning, market entry)
