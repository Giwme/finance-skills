# Teaser

description: Draft anonymous one-page company teasers for sell-side M&A processes. Creates a compelling summary without revealing the company's identity, designed to gauge buyer interest before NDA execution. Triggers on "teaser", "blind teaser", "anonymous profile", "one-pager for process", or "draft teaser for sell-side".

## 输出规则（CRITICAL）

### 直接输出 vs 生成文件

**默认行为：直接输出文本内容**
- Markdown、纯文本内容 → 直接回复，**不生成 .md 文件**
- 除非用户明确要求"生成文件"、"保存为"、"导出"

**需要生成文件的情况：**
- 生成 Excel (.xlsx)、PPT (.pptx)、Word (.docx)、PDF (.pdf) 等二进制文件
- 用户明确要求："生成 md 文件"、"保存报告"、"导出到文件"
- 内容超过 4000 字符，需要作为附件下载

### .done 文件规则

**.done 文件的 `files` 字段只包含二进制文件：**

```python
# 只将二进制文件计入 completed_files（文本内容直接输出）
completed_files = [
    f.name for f in output_dir.iterdir() 
    if f.is_file() 
    and not f.name.startswith(".") 
    and not f.name.endswith(".tmp")
    and f.suffix.lower() in [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".docx", ".pdf"]  # 只包含二进制文件
]
```

## Run ID Isolation (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)

**All file outputs MUST be isolated per request using run_id.**

### Run Context

User messages may contain a marker:

```
[[OPENCLAW_RUN_ID: <run_id>]]
```

**If present, you MUST:**

1. **Extract the run_id** from the marker
2. **When executing any script or generating files, always pass it as:**
   ```
   --run-id <run_id>
   ```
3. **All generated artifacts MUST be written under:**
   ```
   /home/ubuntu/.openclaw-public/workspace/<run_id>/
   ```

**NEVER write artifacts directly into the workspace root.**

### Completion Marker (REQUIRED)

After ALL files are generated:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime

output_dir = Path(f"/home/ubuntu/.openclaw-public/workspace/{run_id}")
completed_files = [
    f.name for f in output_dir.iterdir() 
    if f.is_file() 
    and not f.name.startswith(".") 
    and not f.name.endswith(".tmp")
    and f.suffix.lower() in [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".docx", ".pdf"]  # 只包含二进制文件，文本内容直接输出
]

done_file = output_dir / ".done"
done_data = {
    "status": "completed",
    "run_id": run_id,
    "skill": "teaser",
    "files": completed_files,
    "file_count": len(completed_files),
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
}
done_file.write_text(json.dumps(done_data, indent=2))
```

### Completion Announcement (REQUIRED)

After writing the `.done` file, you MUST announce completion in this exact format:

```
✅ 任务完成，文件已生成：{filename}
```

Example:
```
✅ 任务完成，文件已生成：Project_Alpha_Teaser_2026-03-06.pptx
```

This signals the frontend to display the download card immediately.

**Violation of this rule causes file collisions between concurrent users.**

## OpenAI/Codex Tooling Guardrails (Shared)

Apply these rules when using runtime tools (especially with openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex):

1. Python runtime
- Always use `python3`.
- Never use `python`.

2. web_search language
- For Chinese queries, use `search_lang: "zh-hans"`.
- Do not use `search_lang: "zh"`.
- If language is not critical, omit `search_lang`.

3. web_search execution strategy
- Run searches serially (avoid parallel bursts).
- Use minimum queries needed (typically 3-5).
- Add throttle between calls (~1.2-1.8s).

4. Error auto-recovery
- On 422 with invalid `search_lang`, retry once with `zh-hans`.
- On 429 RATE_LIMITED, back off (wait longer), reduce query count, then retry.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

- Company description (what they do, how they make money)
- Sector / industry
- Key financial metrics: revenue, EBITDA, growth rate, margins
- Geographic footprint
- Key selling points (3-5 highlights)
- What to anonymize vs. disclose
- Target buyer audience (strategic, financial, or both)

### Step 2: Teaser Structure

One page, professionally formatted:

**Header**
- Deal code name (e.g., "Project [Name]")
- Sector descriptor (e.g., "Leading Specialty Industrial Services Platform")
- "Confidential — For Discussion Purposes Only"

**Company Description** (2-3 sentences)
- What the company does, without naming it
- Market position (e.g., "a leading provider of...", "a top-3 player in...")
- Geography (region-level, not city-specific)

**Investment Highlights** (4-6 bullet points)
- Market leadership / positioning
- Revenue quality (recurring %, retention, diversification)
- Growth profile and trajectory
- Margin profile and expansion opportunity
- Management team strength
- Strategic value / synergy potential

**Financial Summary** (table or key metrics)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $XXM |
| Revenue Growth | XX% CAGR |
| EBITDA | $XXM |
| EBITDA Margin | XX% |
| Employees | XXX |

**Transaction Overview** (2-3 sentences)
- What's being offered (100% sale, majority stake, growth equity)
- Indicative timeline
- Contact information for expressions of interest

### Step 3: Anonymization Check

Ensure the teaser doesn't inadvertently identify the company:
- No company name, brand names, or product names
- No specific city (use region: "Southeast US", "Midwest")
- No named customers or partners
- No employee count if it's too distinctive
- Revenue ranges instead of exact figures if the sector is small
- No logos, screenshots, or identifiable imagery

### Step 4: Output

- Word document (.docx) — one page, clean formatting
- PDF version for distribution
- Optional PowerPoint version (single slide)

## Important Notes

- The teaser's job is to generate interest, not close a deal — keep it tight and compelling
- Less is more — a good teaser makes buyers want to sign the NDA to learn more
- Use aspirational but accurate language — "leading", "differentiated", "high-growth" are fine if true
- Include enough financial detail to qualify serious buyers but not so much that tire-kickers waste your time
- Always have the client and legal review before distribution
- Track who receives the teaser — it becomes the outreach log for the process
