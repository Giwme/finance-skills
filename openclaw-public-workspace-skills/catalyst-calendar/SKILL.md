# Catalyst Calendar

description: Build and maintain a calendar of upcoming catalysts across a coverage universe — earnings dates, conferences, product launches, regulatory decisions, and macro events. Helps prioritize attention and position ahead of events. Triggers on "catalyst calendar", "upcoming events", "what's coming up", "earnings calendar", "event calendar", or "catalyst tracker".

## 输出规则（CRITICAL）

### 直接输出 vs 生成文件

**默认行为：直接输出文本内容**
- Markdown、纯文本内容 → 直接回复，**不生成 .md 文件**
- 除非用户明确要求"生成文件"、"保存为"、"导出"

**需要生成文件的情况：**
- 生成 Excel (.xlsx)、PPT (.pptx)、Word (.docx)、PDF (.pdf) 等二进制文件
- 用户明确要求："生成 md 文件"、"保存报告"、"导出到文件"
- 内容超过 4000 字符，需要作为附件下载

### .done 文件规则

**.done 文件的 `files` 字段只包含二进制文件：**

```python
# 只将二进制文件计入 completed_files（文本内容直接输出）
completed_files = [
    f.name for f in output_dir.iterdir() 
    if f.is_file() 
    and not f.name.startswith(".") 
    and not f.name.endswith(".tmp")
    and f.suffix.lower() in [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".docx", ".pdf"]  # 只包含二进制文件
]
```

## Run ID Isolation (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)

**All file outputs MUST be isolated per request using run_id.**

### Run Context

User messages may contain a marker:

```
[[OPENCLAW_RUN_ID: <run_id>]]
```

**If present, you MUST:**

1. **Extract the run_id** from the marker
2. **When executing any script or generating files, always pass it as:**
   ```
   --run-id <run_id>
   ```
3. **All generated artifacts MUST be written under:**
   ```
   /home/ubuntu/.openclaw-public/workspace/<run_id>/
   ```

**NEVER write artifacts directly into the workspace root.**

### Completion Marker (REQUIRED)

After ALL files are generated:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime

output_dir = Path(f"/home/ubuntu/.openclaw-public/workspace/{run_id}")
completed_files = [
    f.name for f in output_dir.iterdir() 
    if f.is_file() 
    and not f.name.startswith(".") 
    and not f.name.endswith(".tmp")
    and f.suffix.lower() in [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".docx", ".pdf"]  # 只包含二进制文件，文本内容直接输出
]

done_file = output_dir / ".done"
done_data = {
    "status": "completed",
    "run_id": run_id,
    "skill": "catalyst-calendar",
    "files": completed_files,
    "file_count": len(completed_files),
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
}
done_file.write_text(json.dumps(done_data, indent=2))
```

### Completion Announcement (REQUIRED)

After writing the `.done` file, you MUST announce completion in this exact format:

```
✅ 任务完成，文件已生成：{filename}
```

Example:
```
✅ 任务完成，文件已生成：Catalyst_Calendar_2026-03-06.xlsx
```

This signals the frontend to display the download card immediately.

**Violation of this rule causes file collisions between concurrent users.**

## OpenAI/Codex Tooling Guardrails (Shared)

Apply these rules when using runtime tools (especially with openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex):

1. Python runtime
- Always use `python3`.
- Never use `python`.

2. web_search language
- For Chinese queries, use `search_lang: "zh-hans"`.
- Do not use `search_lang: "zh"`.
- If language is not critical, omit `search_lang`.

3. web_search execution strategy
- Run searches serially (avoid parallel bursts).
- Use minimum queries needed (typically 3-5).
- Add throttle between calls (~1.2-1.8s).

4. Error auto-recovery
- On 422 with invalid `search_lang`, retry once with `zh-hans`.
- On 429 RATE_LIMITED, back off (wait longer), reduce query count, then retry.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Coverage Universe

- List of companies to track (tickers or names)
- Sector / industry focus
- Include macro events? (Fed meetings, economic data, regulatory deadlines)
- Time horizon (next 2 weeks, month, quarter)

### Step 2: Gather Catalysts

For each company, identify upcoming events:

**Earnings & Financial Events**
- Quarterly earnings date and time (pre/post market)
- Annual shareholder meeting
- Investor day / analyst day
- Capital markets day
- Debt maturity / refinancing dates

**Corporate Events**
- Product launches or announcements
- FDA approvals / regulatory decisions
- Contract renewals or expirations
- M&A milestones (close dates, regulatory approvals)
- Management transitions
- Insider trading windows (lockup expirations)

**Industry Events**
- Major conferences (dates, which companies presenting)
- Trade shows and expos
- Regulatory comment periods or rulings
- Industry data releases (monthly sales, traffic, etc.)

**Macro Events**
- Fed meetings (FOMC dates)
- Jobs report, CPI, GDP releases
- Central bank decisions (ECB, BOJ, etc.)
- Geopolitical events with market impact

### Step 3: Calendar View

| Date | Event | Company/Sector | Type | Impact (H/M/L) | Our Positioning | Notes |
|------|-------|---------------|------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| | | | Earnings/Corp/Industry/Macro | | Long/Short/Neutral | |

### Step 4: Weekly Preview

Each week, generate a forward-looking summary:

**This Week's Key Events:**
1. [Day]: [Company] Q[X] earnings — consensus [$X EPS], our estimate [$X], key focus: [metric]
2. [Day]: [Event] — why it matters for [stocks]
3. [Day]: [Macro release] — expectations and positioning

**Next Week Preview:**
- Early heads-up on important events coming

**Position Implications:**
- Events that could move specific positions
- Any pre-positioning recommended
- Risk management ahead of binary events

### Step 5: Output

- Excel workbook with calendar view and sortable columns
- Weekly preview email/note (markdown)
- Optional: integration with Google Calendar

## Important Notes

- Earnings dates shift — verify against company IR pages and Bloomberg/FactSet closer to the date
- Pre-announce risk: track companies with a history of pre-announcing (positive or negative)
- Conference attendance lists are valuable — which companies are presenting and which are conspicuously absent?
- Some catalysts are recurring (monthly industry data) — build a template and auto-populate
- Color-code by impact level: Red = high impact, Yellow = moderate, Green = routine
- Archive past catalysts with the actual outcome — builds pattern recognition over time
