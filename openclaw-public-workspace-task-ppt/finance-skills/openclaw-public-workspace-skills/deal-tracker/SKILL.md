# Deal Tracker

description: Track multiple live deals with milestones, deadlines, action items, and status updates. Maintains a deal pipeline view and surfaces upcoming deadlines and overdue items. Use when managing a book of business, tracking process milestones, or preparing for weekly deal reviews. Triggers on "deal tracker", "deal status", "where are we on", "process update", "deal pipeline", or "weekly deal review".

## 输出规则（CRITICAL）

### 直接输出 vs 生成文件

**默认行为：直接输出文本内容**
- Markdown、纯文本内容 → 直接回复，**不生成 .md 文件**
- 除非用户明确要求"生成文件"、"保存为"、"导出"

**需要生成文件的情况：**
- 生成 Excel (.xlsx)、PPT (.pptx)、Word (.docx)、PDF (.pdf) 等二进制文件
- 用户明确要求："生成 md 文件"、"保存报告"、"导出到文件"
- 内容超过 4000 字符，需要作为附件下载

### .done 文件规则

**.done 文件的 `files` 字段只包含二进制文件：**

```python
# 只将二进制文件计入 completed_files（文本内容直接输出）
completed_files = [
    f.name for f in output_dir.iterdir() 
    if f.is_file() 
    and not f.name.startswith(".") 
    and not f.name.endswith(".tmp")
    and f.suffix.lower() in [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".docx", ".pdf"]  # 只包含二进制文件
]
```

## Run ID Isolation (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)

**All file outputs MUST be isolated per request using run_id.**

### Run Context

User messages may contain a marker:

```
[[OPENCLAW_RUN_ID: <run_id>]]
```

**If present, you MUST:**

1. **Extract the run_id** from the marker
2. **When executing any script or generating files, always pass it as:**
   ```
   --run-id <run_id>
   ```
3. **All generated artifacts MUST be written under:**
   ```
   /home/ubuntu/.openclaw-public/workspace/<run_id>/
   ```

**NEVER write artifacts directly into the workspace root.**

### Completion Marker (REQUIRED)

After ALL files are generated:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime

output_dir = Path(f"/home/ubuntu/.openclaw-public/workspace/{run_id}")
completed_files = [
    f.name for f in output_dir.iterdir() 
    if f.is_file() 
    and not f.name.startswith(".") 
    and not f.name.endswith(".tmp")
    and f.suffix.lower() in [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".docx", ".pdf"]  # 只包含二进制文件，文本内容直接输出
]

done_file = output_dir / ".done"
done_data = {
    "status": "completed",
    "run_id": run_id,
    "skill": "deal-tracker",
    "files": completed_files,
    "file_count": len(completed_files),
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"
}
done_file.write_text(json.dumps(done_data, indent=2))
```

### Completion Announcement (REQUIRED)

After writing the `.done` file, you MUST announce completion in this exact format:

```
✅ 任务完成，文件已生成：{filename}
```

Example:
```
✅ 任务完成，文件已生成：Deal_Tracker_2026-03-06.xlsx
```

This signals the frontend to display the download card immediately.

**Violation of this rule causes file collisions between concurrent users.**

## OpenAI/Codex Tooling Guardrails (Shared)

Apply these rules when using runtime tools (especially with openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex):

1. Python runtime
- Always use `python3`.
- Never use `python`.

2. web_search language
- For Chinese queries, use `search_lang: "zh-hans"`.
- Do not use `search_lang: "zh"`.
- If language is not critical, omit `search_lang`.

3. web_search execution strategy
- Run searches serially (avoid parallel bursts).
- Use minimum queries needed (typically 3-5).
- Add throttle between calls (~1.2-1.8s).

4. Error auto-recovery
- On 422 with invalid `search_lang`, retry once with `zh-hans`.
- On 429 RATE_LIMITED, back off (wait longer), reduce query count, then retry.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Deal Setup

For each deal, capture:
- **Deal name / code name**: Project [Name]
- **Client**: Seller or buyer name
- **Deal type**: Sell-side, buy-side, financing, restructuring
- **Role**: Lead advisor, co-advisor, fairness opinion
- **Deal size**: Expected enterprise value
- **Stage**: Pre-mandate → Engaged → Marketing → IOI → Diligence → Final bids → Signing → Close
- **Team**: MD, VP, Associate, Analyst assigned
- **Key dates**: Engagement date, CIM distribution, IOI deadline, management meetings, final bid deadline, target close

### Step 2: Milestone Tracking

Track key milestones per deal:

| Milestone | Target Date | Actual Date | Status | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Engagement letter signed | | | | |
| CIM / teaser drafted | | | | |
| Buyer list approved | | | | |
| Teaser distributed | | | | |
| NDA execution | | | | |
| CIM distributed | | | | |
| IOI deadline | | | | |
| IOIs received / reviewed | | | | |
| Shortlist selected | | | | |
| Management meetings | | | | |
| Data room opened | | | | |
| Final bid deadline | | | | |
| Bids received / reviewed | | | | |
| Exclusivity granted | | | | |
| Confirmatory diligence | | | | |
| Purchase agreement signed | | | | |
| Regulatory approval | | | | |
| Close | | | | |

Status: On Track / At Risk / Delayed / Complete

### Step 3: Action Items

Maintain a running action item list across all deals:

| Action | Deal | Owner | Due Date | Priority | Status |
|--------|------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| | | | | P0/P1/P2 | Open/Done/Blocked |

### Step 4: Weekly Deal Review

Generate a summary for weekly team meetings:

**For each active deal:**
1. One-line status update
2. Key developments this week
3. Upcoming milestones (next 2 weeks)
4. Blockers or risks
5. Action items for next week

**Pipeline summary:**
- Total active deals by stage
- Deals at risk (missed milestones, stalled processes)
- New mandates / pitches in pipeline
- Expected closings this quarter

### Step 5: Output

- Excel workbook with:
  - Pipeline overview (all deals, one row each)
  - Per-deal milestone tracker tabs
  - Action item master list
  - Weekly review summary
- Optional: Markdown summary for email/Slack distribution

## Important Notes

- Update the tracker weekly at minimum — stale trackers are worse than no tracker
- Flag deals where milestones are slipping — early warning prevents surprises
- Action items without owners and due dates don't get done — be specific
- The pipeline view should show deal stage, size, and likelihood — useful for revenue forecasting
- Keep notes on buyer/investor feedback — patterns inform strategy adjustments
- Archive closed/dead deals separately — keep the active view clean
